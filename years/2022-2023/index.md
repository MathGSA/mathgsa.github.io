# Math Department Mini-GSA

The Math Mini-GSA (MathGSA) represents the interests of the mathematics graduate students at UCR. In particular we want to provide a forum to discuss ways that we can work together to improve the department, and we also aim to create a sense of community among the math graduate students.

<!-- Meetings will be held the first Monday of each month, 3:30&ndash;5pm in Skye 268. -->
